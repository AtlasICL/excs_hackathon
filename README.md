# EXCS Movember Hackathon
## Team: Misha Artemiev, Etienne Hackett, Emre Acarsoy

This is our team submission for the Exeter Computer Science Movember Hackathon, with the theme Code for Good / Men's Health.  

## Summary

Our project is a mood tracking website. Users can register with a username and password, and log in to track their mood.  
Upon logging in, they can select an emoji based on how they feel. They will then get relevant advice for their mood, and will be able to view their mood history over the past month.
